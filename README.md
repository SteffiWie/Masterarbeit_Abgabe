# Masterarbeit_Abgabe

This code is part of my master thesis.

Three regression models 

- random forest (RF) trained on aggregated data
- virtual stochastic Langevin Boosting (vSGLB)
- gaussian process regression (GPR)
  
are identified for their suitability for algorithm selection of an time series classification algorithm that can quantify uncertainties in their performance prediction.

## Toy Problem 1

This toy problem qualitatively assess how well the selected regression models quantify aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the presented toy problem, and thus address the question of how well the uncertainties can be attributed to their sources.

## Toy Problem 2

This toy problem qualitatively assess the effects of an increase in the number of training points, in particular on the quantification of epistemic uncertainty. The effects can be interactively visualized.

## Toy Problem 3

This toy problem qualitatively assess the effects of introducing one or more additional meta-features to distinguish instances on the quantified uncertainties.
